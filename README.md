# Python-Reddit-Webscraper-

This is a webscraper for Reddit that gathers the words from a subreddit's posts or titles and generates a word cloud of the most commonly occurring terms. The idea behind this project was really to investigate which words would occur more commonly on certain subreddits.

To run the project, ensure that the adequate information is filled out on the `config.py` file. Then, make sure that all imported dependencies in all the `.py` files are properly installed. Finally, simply run `python main.py` on the CLI in order to get the project running.
